01/03/1971                  4004    10      DIP16    10000            4      0.74                 0.75                  The 4004 is a 4-bit, DIP16 microprocessor that operates at a mighty 740KHz â€” and at roughly eight clock cycles per instruction cycle (fetch, decode, execute), that means the chip is capable of executing up to 92,600 instructions per second.
01/04/1972                  8008    10      DIP18    10000            8      0.50                 0.80                  The first 8-bit microprocessor, 5 months after Intel 4004 microprocessor. The 8008 is available in two speed grades - 500 KHz and 800 KHz, but even the faster version 8008-1 is running a bit slower (in instructions per second) than the 4004.
01/01/1974                  4040    10      DIP24    10000            4      0.50                 0.74                  General Performance is equal to the 4004 with additional improvements in the addition of extra lines and instructions to recognise and service interrupts and hardware Halt/Stop commands an extended internal stack and general-purpose "Index" register space to handle nesting of several subroutines and/or interrupts, plus a doubling of program ROM address range.
