01/03/1971                  4004                 10          DIP16       10000            4      0.74                 0.75                 The 4004 is a 4-bit, DIP16 microprocessor that operates at a mighty 740KHz — and at roughly eight clock cycles per instruction cycle (fetch, decode, execute), that means the chip is capable of executing up to 92,600 instructions per second.
01/04/1972                  8008                 10          DIP18       10000            8      0.50                 0.80                 The first 8-bit microprocessor, 5 months after Intel 4004 microprocessor. The 8008 is available in two speed grades - 500 KHz and 800 KHz, but even the faster version 8008-1 is running a bit slower (in instructions per second) than the 4004.
01/01/1974                  4040                 10          DIP24       10000            4      0.50                 0.74                 General Performance is equal to the 4004 with additional improvements in the addition of extra lines and instructions to recognise and service interrupts and hardware Halt/Stop commands an extended internal stack and general-purpose "Index" register space to handle nesting of several subroutines and/or interrupts, plus a doubling of program ROM address range.
01/04/1974                  8080                 10          DIP18       6000             8      2                       3                 Comissioned by CTC but failing to meet expectations, Intel has decided to release the 8080 to the general public. A successor to the popular 8008, The 8080 includes many enhancements: Maximum memory size was expanded to 64 KB, Stack size is no longer limited to 7 levels, the number of I/O ports was increased to 256, many new instructions and a direct addressing mode. All in a beautiful white ceramic package.
01/03/1976                  8085                 35          DIP40       3000             8      3                       6                 As successor to the 8080 with only two minor instructions added to support its new interrupt and serial input/output features. However, it requires less support circuitry, allowing simpler and less expensive microcomputer systems to be built. The "5" in the part number highlighted the fact that the 8085 uses a single +5-volt (V) power supply by using depletion-mode transistors, rather than requiring the +5 V, −5 V and +12 V supplies needed by the 8080.
01/06/1978                  8086                 37          DIP40       3000             16     5                      10                 The 8086 features a new instruction set called x86 but is still source-code compatible with the 8080 and 8085. The 8086 is utilizing a full 16-Bit architecture and is able to address up to 1 MEGABYTE of RAM! “For the first time, we were going to look at processor features from a software perspective,” says Morse, the sole designer for the 8086. “The question was not ‘What features do we have space for?’ but ‘What features do we want in order to make the software more efficient?’”
01/06/1979                  8088                 30          DIP40       3000             8      4.77                   16                 The 8088 is architecturally very similar to the 8086. The main difference is that there are only eight data lines instead of the 8086's 16 lines. In short, an 8088 typically runs about half as fast as 8086 clocked at the same rate, because of the bus bottleneck. What was Intel thinking?
01/01/1982                  186                  99          PGA68       3000             16     6                      25                 Intel's first PGA chip released today! The 186 is an enhanced version of Intel 8086 16-bit processor. Being completely object code compatible with the 8086, the 186 integrates many system components into one chip, added 7 new instructions, and added new operand types to three existing 8086 instructions. The Intel 186 microprocessor is not very different from the 8086, and, because of this, may be considered as an embedded version of 8086.
02/02/1982                  286                  239         PGA68       1500             16     5                      25                 The 286 is the first of the x86 CPU family to support protected virtual-address mode, commonly called "protected mode" allowing access to 16 MB of RAM and was designed for multi-user systems with multitasking applications, communications and real-time process control. The performance increase of the 286 over the 8086 (or 8088) can be 3-6 times! 
17/10/1985                  386                  299         PGA132      1000             32     12                     40                 The 386 is Intels first High Performance 32bit CPU featuring the new IA-32 Instruction Set for x86. Early in production, Intel discovered a marginal circuit that could cause a system to return incorrect results from 32-bit multiply operations. Not all of the processors already manufactured were affected, so Intel tested its inventory. Processors that were found to be bug-free were marked with a double sigma (ΣΣ), and affected processors were marked "16 BIT S/W ONLY".
10/04/1989                  486DX                950         PGA168      600              32     16                     50                 The 486DX packs 1.2 million transistors, compared to 275,000 on the 386. Capable of handling 15 million instructions per second, it offers as much as four times the processing power of the 386. But at $950 each, the 486 is also nearly three times as costly as the 386. While chip prices routinely drop sharply over time, the high initial price tag is expected to limit the near-term 486 market to high-end applications where customers are willing to pay a premium for performance.
22/04/1991                  486SX                665         PGA168      600              32     16                     50                 The 486SX is a 'low-cost' version of the 486DX without FPU to cut cost.
03/03/1992                  486DX2                           PGA168      600              32     40                     66                 The 486DX2 is nearly identical to the 486DX, but comes with a clock multiplier. It is the first chip to use clock doubling, a 486DX2 is thus significantly faster than a 486DX at the same bus speed thanks to the 8K on-chip cache shadowing the slower clocked external bus. Coupled with 8-16 MB RAM and a VLB video card, the CPU is capable of playing every title available (and for years after to come!), making it a "sweet spot" in CPU performance and longevity.
22/03/1993                  Pentium-P5                       PGA273      800              32     60                     66                 Intel's new Flagship on a huge PGA273 socket - likely due to the return to the 0.8um process. It features a new architecture called 'Superscalar' that delivers parallel execution of instructions - for a 4x performance increase over the DX2. It packs 3.1 million transistors and also features 16K L1 cache and a massive 256K of L2 cache on die. 
07/03/1994                  486DX4                           PGA168      600              32     75                    100                 Intel continues the tradition of multiplying the clocks of their 486, this time tripling it with the DX4. Additionally, a new write-back cache replaces the write-through cache that had been utilized in previous models. 
10/10/1994                  Pentium-P54                      PGA296      600              32     75                    100                 Intel brings us an optimized Pentium with higher frequencies, shrunk process and even bigger socket.
27/03/1995                  Pentium-P54CQS                   PGA320      350              32     120                   120                 Intel brings us an optimized Pentium with higher frequencies - again.
12/06/1995                  Pentium-P54CS                    PGA320      350              32     133                   133                 Intel brings us an optimized Pentium with higher frequencies - again.
